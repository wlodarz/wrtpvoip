#Drivers for TNETV1050 C55x DSP, telephony interface, etc.

= Introduction =

The drivers are done using reverse engineering technique.


= Details =

Modules:
  * hwdsp: initialization, reset, and "tight loop" functions for C55x module. Mostly completed, not tested. I think hwu_lin_dsp_loop shows how to execute code on DSP.
  * tiuhal: TNETV1050's mcbsp module driver. Fairly completed, big parts not "decompiled" completely. Not tested. First test should use tnetv1050_tid_init/read/write to read Legerity chip ID.


Future:
  * implement some MIPS<->DSP msg exchange system (dspgateway?). It should be "timer" based, since there's no interrupt from DSP to MIPS.
  * run and test the whole Legerity API.
  * write some "external" API, and asterisk module for it, or use some existing kernel api (telephony api?).

Any help would be really appreciated
